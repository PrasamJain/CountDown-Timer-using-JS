# CountDown-Timer-using-JS

With the help of javascript timing object we create a countdown timer.
A countdown timer can be defined as a virtual clock that counts down from a certain Date/Time 
or number to indicate the end or beginning of an offer or events.

In this repo we make a timing countDown timer, Which countdown in the formate of "Hr : Min : Sec".

Basic operations we use for making it :-

    setInterval( Function_name , time_in_ms )               // repeat after every certain time interval.
  
    clearInterval(instance)             // to stop the timer
